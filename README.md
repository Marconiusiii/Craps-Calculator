# Craps Calculator
A bet progression calculator for the game of Craps.

## Purpose

This is a small script that allows you to enter your initial bet and the number you want to simulate rolling. The script will show a power pressing bet progression for 8 rolls, including how much you'd need to add to your winnings to get to the next power press bet level.

### Place 4 and 10

The 4 and 10 are set to an auto-buy progression, meaning that each win will pay true odds of 2:1 minus the 5% commission/vig. This will reflect in the winnings shown in the calculator output. Normally, the 4 and 10 pay out 9:5, but most casinos now have an auto-buy set in place for bets of $10 or more.

### Place 5 and 9

The 5 and 9 pay out 7:5, and all bets must be made in a multiple of 5. The exception is a $36 bet which will pay out $50 when rounded by the dealers.

### Place 6 and 8

The 6 and 8 pay out 7:6, so all bets must be made in multiples of 6. There are some extra exceptions with a $25 bet, but those are not reflected in the calculator.
